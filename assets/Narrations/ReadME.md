Hello! This narration files project is for QCONRAD's Intellistar Emulator on GitHub.com. Please read this file carefully and it contains useful information!

This directory contains the following folders:

- "conditions" = Narration for current conditions.
- "forcasts"   = Narration for forecasting.
- "main"       = Narration for the different information screens (Radar, Intro, ect.)
- "temperature" = Narration for temperature from -99 degress, to 139 degrees.
- "README.md" = The file you're reading right now.

The folder(s) "conditions" and "forecasts" both contain a plain text document "FileName_KEY.txt". That file will tell you what the abbreviations in the narrations' file names mean for you convenience and ease of reading.

The narrations contained are HD voice on narrations from The Weather Channel's Local on The 8s without background music. Most of the narrations are contained here, however there are still a few missing, such as the narration for "High" and "Low" and chances of precipitation for example.

I have uploaded the Narrations to Google Drive, so that once the Developer downloads it the files may be extracted from the ZIP and be placed in this folder retaining the existing file structure (as stated above).

# intellistar-emulator
A work in progress web application that displays weather information in the same visual presentation as the cable headend unit [Intellistar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliStar).

## Overview
This is a local forecast segment that airs on The Weather Channel called the "Local on the 8s". The name is because it airs at timeslots that end in "8" (9:28, 2:48, etc.). The forecast is approximately a minute long and provides information on current and forecasted weather conditions. This style was started in 2013 and has been revised slightly throughout.

## Instructions
1. Extract all contents into folder
2. Run index.html in Google Chrome
3. Enter zip code
4. Click start
5. Press F11 for fullscreen

## Features
Most of core animation and logic has been replicated included severe weather alerts, forecast descriptions, crawl text, and the Doppler radar map. Some things are still missing such as most icons, 7-day forecast, and narrations.
